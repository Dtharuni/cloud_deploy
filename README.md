Real-time tracking and AI-powered behavior analysis along with strong geofencing alarms constitute the AI-Powered Geofencing and Dog Tracking System to keep dogs safe. Tracking data gathered from the GPS device which detects movements as well as records sounds gets transmitted to analyze with AI software. Mobile and web dashboards enable owners to receive automated alerts using push notifications with boundary breach or abnormal behavior detection through SMS and email. The novel monitoring system works to protect pets and provide better inspection while delivering enhanced attachments between pets and their handlers.
